calculating rho:

P_tot = P_gas + P_rad
P_gas = P_tot - P_rad

P_gas = rho T / (mu m_H)
so
rho = (P_tot - 0.33 a T^4) mu m_H / T


gamma = 5/3 --> from ideal gas

What we accomplishe today:
	We made a runge kutta file that will take initial values and stop values
	We created a function file that contains all necessary files

Next Step:
	Create main function that will call RK and function, run them to get data
	Run with known values of sun to make sure it works(after we correct errors,especially michaels!)
	Create file to have multiple initial conditions to run for many different stars
	plot r vs P
	plot r vs mu
	plot r vs L
	plot r vs T
	plot T vs L
