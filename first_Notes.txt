#Notes from the first meeting to determine best course of action


each star simulation is going to be held constant in time, ie with a constant X,Y,Z

STEPS
define functions to have m_tot X,Y,Y
define each epsilon (epsilon_pp, epsilon_cno, epsilon_3alpha) should have its own function, as they are rediculously long. epsilon is a function of T & rho





S
If we cannot define our initial density and Temperature, then perhaps we will have to create a backwards fucntion that will change our rho_0 until we get a matching mass
