File format is binary with each record consisting of:
mass x y z vx vy vz

Plus a header at the top:  N and time.

The default is single precision. Add -DDOUBLE_PRECISION in the 
Makefile to use double precision.

The parameter file needs:
input = <input file>
output = <base for output>
dt = <time step>
eps = <softening length>
steps = <number of steps>
theta = <opening criteria>

If theta < 0; a fixed opening criteria of -theta is used.
If theta > 0; a dynamic opening criteria is used such that
the maximum absolute force error is fixed.
